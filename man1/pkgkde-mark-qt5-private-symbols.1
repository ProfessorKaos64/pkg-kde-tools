.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpkgkde\-mark\-qt5\-private\-symbols\fR is a helper tool to mark private
symbols inside symbols files based on version tags inserted by the Qt
buildsystem.

Symbols that are tagged with \fBQt_5_PRIVATE_API\fR will be marked as private.

as patches to stdout. If the option \fB\-\-write\-results\fR is passed, it will
instead overwrite the original symbols files.
